# Changelog 📝

All notable changes to the **Rullst Framework** will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/), and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [0.9.0] - 2026-05-25 🚀

### Added (The "Unfair Advantage" & Local AI Dev Tooling)
- **Declarative E2E Testing (`rullst::testing`)**:
  - Introduced a fluent, high-level testing framework for complete application workflows.
  - Added `TestClient` to mount and run HTTP routing logic over the Axum application without actual TCP binding.
  - Implemented standard HTTP builders with convenient `.await` execution via Rust's `IntoFuture` trait.
  - Provided extensive cookie-based assertions (`.assert_cookie()`) and structured payload assertions (`.assert_json_value()`).
- **Built-in Feature Flags (`rullst::feature`)**:
  - Implemented full-stack toggles and dynamic A/B test splits with zero external runtime dependencies.
  - Support for `EnvDriver`, `MemoryDriver`, `TomlDriver`, and `DatabaseDriver` (backed by SQLx with a thread-safe TTL Cache for near-zero latency DB lookups).
  - High-performance deterministic consistency hash utilizing a custom MurmurHash3 implementation for stable weighted rollouts.
- **AI-Powered "Self-Healing" Error Console (`rullst::error_console`)**:
  - Gorgeous interactive glassmorphic web dashboard (`rullst-ignition`) triggered on application panics.
  - Seamless tokio panic interception using a custom `std::panic::set_hook` implementation to isolate runtime worker thread crashes.
  - Direct local code-snippet lookup pointing to the exact file, module, and line index where the panic occurred.
  - Integrated local AI-healing assistant that resolves runtime errors and can patch files directly back to the physical disk on a single web interface click.

### Security & Quality Audit Fixes (Audit 2026-05-25)
- **Security Enhancements**:
  - SEC-1: Removed unsafe `std::env::set_var("RUST_BACKTRACE", "1")` in `server.rs` (unsound in multi-threaded environments) and replaced it with a safe warning prompting the user to set the env var.
  - SEC-2: Added strict path traversal protection to the `/_rullst/autofix` endpoint in `error_console.rs` (verifies paths are canonicalized and located within the project root, restricts edits to `.rs` and `.toml` files).
  - SEC-3: Added a startup warning in `auth.rs` when the default development `APP_KEY` is used.
- **Spec & API Alignments**:
  - Marked `Server`, `Router`, `HtmxRequest`, and `HtmxResponse` as `#[non_exhaustive]` per Rullst Spec §9.1 to ensure future-proof API stability.
  - Replaced a `panic!` in `Storage::disk()` with a graceful fallback `ErrorDriver` returning `StorageError::DriverError` on all methods when an unknown disk is requested.
- **Performance & Reliability**:
  - Migrated `LocalDriver` in `storage.rs` from blocking `std::fs` to fully asynchronous `tokio::fs` operations.
  - Optimized Redis `CacheDriver`'s `flush()` method to use a memory-efficient `SCAN` cursor loop instead of the blocking `KEYS *` pattern.
- **Testing & CI/CD**:
  - Added full test coverage for the wrapper `Router` in `routing.rs`, the builder in `server.rs`, and argument translation in `artisan.rs`.
  - Created a GitHub Actions CI pipeline (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`) enforcing automated test suites, clippy lint checks, and rustfmt checks.


## [0.8.0] - 2026-05-25 🛡️

### Added (Self-Healing Upgrades & Architectures)

  - Added `structured_prompt<T>` helper to parse LLM outputs into strongly typed Rust structs, automatically sanitizing markdown wraps (e.g., ` ```json ... ``` `).
